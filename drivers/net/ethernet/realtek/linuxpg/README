	  This is the package for pgtool of Realtek. There are two methods to use
	this tool. The method 1 is through a script file. However, you have to use
	the Method 2 if the Method 1 doesn't work.
	  If you use the embedded system, you maybe have to build "pgdrv.ko" first
	for the target platform. Please reference the Step 2 of Method 2. And the
	steps may be different.

Method 1:
	Step 1: Run the script file to load the necessary elements.
	# ./pgload.sh

	Step 2: Run the pgtool "rtnicpg". Use /h to show user guide.
	# ./rtnicpg /h | more

	Step 3: Choose the cmd to pg.
	Example: Read the EEPROM for the first NIC card.
	# ./rtnicpg /r /eeprom /# 1

	Step 4: Unload the elements of pgtool.
	# rmmod pgdrv


Method 2:
	Step 1: Unload all the NIC driver for Realtek.
	# rmmod r8169
	# rmmod r8168
	# rmmod r8101

	Step 2: Build the pgdrv.ko and install it.
	# make clean all
	# insmod pgdrv.ko

	Step 3: Run the pgtool "rtnicpg". Use /h to show user guide.
	# ./rtnicpg /h | more

	Step 4: Choose the cmd to pg.
	Example: Read the EEPROM for the first NIC card.
	# ./rtnicpg /r /eeprom /# 1

	Step 5: Remove the pgdrv.
	# rmmod pgdrv

[NOTICE]
	1. The applications are only for little-endian platform.
	2. Must login with "root".
	3. The NIC driver must be unload first or the pgdrv.ko cannot work.
